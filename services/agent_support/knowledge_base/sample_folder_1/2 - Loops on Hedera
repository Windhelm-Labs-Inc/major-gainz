# **DeFi Looping Strategy on Hedera – Gain Maximization Guide**

## **Overview**

The **looping strategy** in DeFi refers to repeatedly borrowing against collateral, then re-supplying the borrowed funds as additional collateral, in order to amplify yield. On Hedera, this strategy benefits from the network’s **low fees**, **fast finality**, and **predictable transaction costs**, making it more efficient than on many other chains.

## **How Looping Works**

1. **Supply Collateral** – Deposit an asset (e.g., HBAR, stablecoins, HTS tokens) into a lending protocol.
2. **Borrow Against Collateral** – Take a loan using the supplied collateral, leaving a safety buffer below the liquidation threshold.
3. **Re-Supply Borrowed Assets** – Deposit the borrowed funds back into the lending protocol to increase total supplied collateral.
4. **Repeat** – Borrow against the newly increased collateral, then supply again.
5. **Harvest Rewards** – Collect interest, token incentives, or liquidity mining rewards on the inflated collateral base.

---

## **Goal**

Maximize yield by **increasing effective supply** without additional capital input, leveraging Hedera’s efficiency to reduce the cost drag of multiple borrow/supply cycles.

---

## **Risks**

* **Liquidation Risk** – If asset price drops or borrow interest spikes, collateral may be liquidated.
* **Variable APY** – Borrow and supply rates can change, impacting net yield.
* **Execution Slippage** – Delays in looping steps may create mismatched debt/collateral values.
* **Smart Contract Risk** – Vulnerabilities in the lending protocol could impact funds.

---

## **Example Calculation**

If:

* **Collateral APY** = 10%
* **Borrow APY** = 5%
* **Loop Iterations** = 3 cycles at 70% LTV

Net leveraged supply after looping could be **\~2.4× initial collateral**, producing a net APY of:

```
Net APY ≈ (Supply APY × leverage factor) − (Borrow APY × borrowed amount)
```

This results in a higher yield than supplying without looping, assuming APY spread remains positive.

## **Loop Execution on Hedera**

**Manual Approach**

* Use Hedera-compatible DeFi apps (e.g., SaucerSwap, Heliswap integrated lending partners).
* Execute supply, borrow, and re-supply transactions in sequence.
* Monitor health factor before each borrow.

**Automated Approach**

* Write a script using the **Hiero SDK** (JavaScript, Java, Python, Rust) to:

  1. Query health factor and borrowing capacity.
  2. Borrow up to safe limit (e.g., 65–75% LTV).
  3. Supply borrowed asset back.
  4. Loop until target leverage is reached.

**Pseudocode:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < maxLoops; i++) {
    borrowAmount = checkAvailableBorrow(collateralAsset);
    if (borrowAmount < minThreshold) break;
    executeBorrow(borrowAmount);
    executeSupply(borrowAmount);
}
```

## **Best Practices for Maximizing Gains**

1. **Stay Well Below Liquidation LTV** – Use a conservative buffer (10–20%) for volatility protection.
2. **Automate Health Checks** – Run frequent checks via mirror node APIs to prevent overexposure.
3. **Factor in Fees** – Even on Hedera, account for small network and protocol fees to ensure net positive yield.
4. **Limit Loop Iterations** – Diminishing returns occur as borrow APY approaches supply APY.
5. **Diversify Assets** – Avoid over-leveraging a single volatile asset.

---

## **Why Hedera is Ideal for Looping**

* **Sub-cent Fees** – Enables many iterations without eroding yield.
* **3–5 Second Finality** – Reduces execution risk between loop steps.
* **HTS Support** – Looping possible with both native HBAR and Hedera Token Service assets.
* **EVM Compatibility** – Can use Solidity lending protocols with Hedera system contracts for speed and efficiency.

## **Key Takeaway**

Looping can **amplify returns** in Hedera DeFi ecosystems when executed carefully. The strategy hinges on balancing **LTV safety**, **positive APY spread**, and **efficient transaction execution** — all areas where Hedera’s network properties give an edge.
